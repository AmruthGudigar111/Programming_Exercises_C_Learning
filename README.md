🔷 **C Programming Lab – 10 Practice Programs**

This repository contains 10 fundamental C programming exercises designed for beginners to strengthen their concepts in core C programming. These programs cover topics from basic input/output to file handling and structures.

## 🔍 Program List

1. **Basic I/O and Arithmetic**
   - Input two numbers and perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

2. **Conditional Statements**
   - Check whether a number is positive, negative, or zero.

3. **Loops – Factorial**
   - Calculate the factorial of a number using a `for` loop.

4. **Prime Number Check**
   - Check if a number is a prime number.

5. **Array Operations**
   - Find the largest and smallest elements in an array.

6. **Matrix Addition**
   - Add two 3x3 matrices.

7. **String Operations**
   - Count the number of vowels, consonants, digits, and white spaces in a string.

8. **Function Usage**
   - Create a function to check if a number is a palindrome.

9. **Structure**
   - Store and display student information using structures.

10. **File Handling**
   - Read from and write data to a file.
